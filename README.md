# Integrated Skill Tracker using Web Scraping
Hi this is IRDi! aka Serpant!
This project is an Integrated Skill Tracker web application that scrapes job listing websites to track the skills that are currently in demand in the job market. The application uses Django as the web framework, Selenium for web scraping, and Celery for task scheduling. This application serves as a central hub for various skill practicing websites, including HackerRank, Codechef, etc. Users can access these websites through a single platform, making it easier to track progress and improve skills...

## Prerequisites

To run this app on your local machine, you will need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6+
- Django 3.2+
- Selenium 3.141+
- Celery 5.0+

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SumitM01/Integrated-skill-tracker-using-webscraping.git
```

Install the required dependencies using pip

```pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Set up your MongoDB and create a `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string:

```Python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'database_name',
        'USER': 'database_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'database_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```
Run the database migrations
```Python
python manage.py migrate

```
Start the Celery worker
```Python
celery -A Integrated_Coding worker -l info

```
Start the Django development server
```Python
python manage.py runserver

```
Access the web application at `http://localhost:8000/`

## Usage/Examples

Create a new skill to track by clicking the "New Skill" button on the home page.

Enter the skill name and select the job listing websites to scrape for job postings related to that skill.

Click "Save" to create the new skill and start the scraping process.

The scraping process is run asynchronously using Celery, so the user can continue using the application while the scraping is ongoing.

Once the scraping is complete, the user can view the list of job postings related to the skill by clicking the skill name on the home page.
